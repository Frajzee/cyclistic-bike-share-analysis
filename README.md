# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Overview
Case study from Google Data Analytics course. Goal: find out how members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Data used is Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 from Divvy (Chicago).

## Tools
R (readxl, dplyr, ggplot2) in RStudio.

## Process
- Loaded both Excel files.  
- Fixed column names and user type labels (Customer/Subcriber â†’ casual/member).  
- Combined datasets.  
- Added ride length (in minutes) and day of week.  
- Did simple summaries and plots.  

## Findings
- Casual riders ride longer but less often.  
- Members ride shorter trips but much more often.  
- Members ride more on weekdays, casuals more on weekends.  

## Recommendations
1. Weekend-focused membership deals.  
2. Discounts for tourists/leisure casuals.  
3. Promote cost savings for commuters.  

## Notes
This is a learning project, only Q1 data was used. Still it shows clear differences between members and casual riders.
